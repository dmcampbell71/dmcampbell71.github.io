So this is what a code insert would look like:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

timeout=2

while [ : ] ; do
    clear
    tree -C /app/EMTools/data/ -I completed
    echo
    echo
    echo "Press 'q' to exit"
    read -t ${timeout} -s -n 1 k
    if [[ $k = q ]] ; then
        break
    fi
done
```

Now what could we do with this?
